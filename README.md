# PyFighter

The first <i>big</i> game that I made. PyFighter is a 2-player Street Fighter clone I made with one other person.

I was responsible for the entire "game" component of the program along with extracting the sprite graphics, and my partner did all the menus (i.e. any clean, Object Oriented code is mine).

Made in June 2012 over a weekend.
